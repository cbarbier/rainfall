# trying to inject some shellcode on the strcpy return
# without success. We search in the heap, and found out that
# when the first malloc is overflowed after 20 bytes, it overrides
# second malloc inner data which contains malloc'd data. (cf source)
# Thus with the strcpy we can write anything anywhere
# There's an uncalled function m that prints the token instead of ~~
# Replacing the puts call (0x08048400 <+0>:	jmp    *0x8049928) with m call (0x80484f4) reveals the flag.
